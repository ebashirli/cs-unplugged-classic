# Free activities for classroom or home

CS Unplugged is a collection of [free learning activities](/activities/) that teach Computer Science through engaging games and puzzles that use cards, string, crayons and lots of running around.

The activities introduce students to Computational Thinking through concepts such as [binary numbers](/activities/binary-numbers/), [algorithms](/activities/sorting-algorithms/) and [data compression](/activities/text-compression/), separated from the distractions and technical details of having to use computers. Importantly, no programming is required to engage with these ideas!
