## You Can Say That Again!

Many computer users are familiar with compressed formats such as zip, gzip, or gif images.
These are based on a method called Ziv-Lempel coding, which turns out to be an interesting exercise in finding patterns in text.

Children's rhymes and stories are good examples for text compression, because they often involve repeated words and sequences.
