## Lightest and Heaviest

Almost any list that comes out of a computer is sorted into some sort of order, and there are many more sorted lists inside computers that the user doesn't see. Many clever algorithms have been devised for putting values into order efficiently.

In this activity students compare different algorithms to sort weights in order.

### More lessons and activities

- Misha Leder, a Software Engineer at Google has an activity called [ Sorting ](https://sites.google.com/site/childrenandtechnology/Home/presentation-4-sorting) that looks at what sorting is, what it is for, by what criteria can one sort things, and different sorting algorithms (selection, insertion and bubble sort). Have kids sort themselves and time them.

### Sorting algorithms visualisations

- To visually demonstrate the concept of  some popular algorithms for sorting data, see the following website developed by David Martin at [http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/).
- [Aldo Cortesi's ](http://corte.si/) Canvas visualisation of algorithms is another way to visualise sorting algorithms by Jacob Seidelin at Canvas Visualizations of Sorting Algorithms Teachers could print these out for different search parameters for different sort algorithms and hang these canvases as posters in the classroom. These could then be used in quizzing the students on specific algorithms or comparing sorts side by side. See also Cortesi's Blog at [Visualising Sorting Algorithms](http://corte.si/posts/code/visualisingsorting/index.html)
- Another visual or timed view of sorting algorithms developed by [David Eck](http://math.hws.edu/eck/) can be seen at [The xSortLab Applet](http://math.hws.edu/TMCM/java/xSortLab/index.html).

- A famous story about the boy wonder of mathematics has taken on a life of its own. American Scientist has an article called [Gauss's Day of Reckoning ](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/gausss-day-of-reckoning) by [ Bryan Hayes](http://www.americanscientist.org/authors/detail/brian-hayes). The number of comparisons made for the simple sorting methods can be calculated using the sum 1+2+3+…+n-1, which is equal to n(n-1)/2. This series is often associated with stories of the mathematician. Gauss, who apparently used this equality to frustrate a teacher who had assigned the class to add up all the numbers from 1 to 100. There's a wonderful article about whether or not this story is apocryphal.
