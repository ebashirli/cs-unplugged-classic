## Commentaries on teaching computing

- Peter Denning's [Great Principles of Computing](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/great-principles-computing) – developing a framework for computer science as a science and for the sciences. The "Great Principles" complements the Unplugged work because Unplugged is seeking to stimulate young people's curiosity and excitement about computing principles, and we will be striving to cover as many of the principles as we can.
- The [Code.org Advocacy Coalition](https://code.org/advocacy) is "a non-partisan group that believes computer science should be part of the core curriculum in education, and that we must increase participation and access for girls and underrepresented students of color." The site offers a lot of information to support advocacy for computing in the curriculum, including a ["Promote Computer Science"](https://code.org/promote) page.
- [Lockhart's Lament](http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devangle.html), an insightful discussion of the teaching of mathematics in schools, which could equally well be applied to the teaching of Computer Science.

## Other interesting links
- If you like CS Unplugged… you may enjoy the movie ["The Professor and his beloved equation"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Professor%27s_Beloved_Equation_%28film%29), which is a wonderful story that happens to teach an appreciation for mathematics, but will appeal to a wide range of people due to the great cinematography, intriguing plot, and great acting. The soundtrack is in Japanese, but the DVD has subtitles. It is based on a[book by Yoko Ogawa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Professor_and_his_Beloved_Equation). (The book and film have several translated titles, including "The Gift of Numbers").
- UK Presenter and Comedian, [Alan Davies ](http://www.fansofalandavies.co.uk/)embarks on a maths odyssey with the help of mathematician [Marcus du Sautoy](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/dusautoy/)in this series of informative videos on the importance of Mathematics and it's applications in everyday life. These videos offer good motivation for students who are usually not interested in Mathematics. See the documentary [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmMaPAfE59Q).
- Some of the "Unplugged" material is being distributed in cooperation with the [Humanity Libraries Project](http://www.humaninfo.org/).
- Creative teachers can use music to teach content across the curriculum – to students of all ages. Visit [Songs for Teaching: The Definitive Source for Educational Music ](http://www.songsforteaching.com/index.html)for children's songs, lyrics, sound clips and teaching suggestions.

- [SNAP: Math Fairs ](http://www.mathfair.com/puzzles.html)features puzzles for different levels of students who can learn Maths using puzzles. <ul>
    - Misha Leder, a Software Engineer at Google has resources to introduce children to Maths at [Introducing Formulas and Variables](https://sites.google.com/site/childrenandtechnology/Home/introducing-formulas-and-variables).

-[Packetville ](http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/netacad/packetville/index.html)is an online community packed with educational games, lesson plans, assessment materials, information for parents, awards for students, great graphics, catchy music, and loads of student activities that will help your students meet the national standards in educational technology. You'll find that Packetville resources fit into many subject areas, especially computer classes and social studies. Better yet, consider creating a dynamic Packetville Club in your classroom or as an after-school activity. Packetville is a fun way to teach your students how the Internet works and how they can help others through the use of technology.
- [NCSS Challenge ](https://groklearning.com/challenge/?utm_source=challenge-ncss&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=challengeweb)is run by the School of Information Technologies at the [University of Sydney](http://sydney.edu.au/) as part of the [National Computer Science School (NCSS)](http://ncss.edu.au/). The Challenge is unlike any other programming competition because we will teach you how to program as we go along rather than expecting you to be an expert coder already. However, if you are a seasoned coder, we have something for you too because the problems will range from relatively simple through to mind-bendingly hard. If you have questions or comments please [email NCSS](mailto:challenge@ncss.edu.au).
-[Puzzle-Based Lerarning ](http://www.puzzlebasedlearning.edu.au/)developed by [Zbigniew Michalewicz ](http://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~zbyszek/)and [Matthew Michalewicz ](http://www.michalewicz.com.au/)is a new teaching and learning methodology that is focused on the development of problem-solving skills. Try sample puzzles at [Puzzle 2.5 illustrates the Monty Hall problem ](http://www.puzzlebasedlearning.edu.au/puzzle-2-5/)and [Puzzle 6.8 illustrates the well-know egg-drop experiment (purchase now required)](http://www.puzzlebasedlearning.edu.au/about-the-book/purchase-the-book/).

- Tom Bradley, a Computer Science Graduate from Swansea has written a paper on Building interactive learning tools for the Computer Science Unplugged course
- [Donald Knuth ](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/)gives the [Turing Lecture 2011](http://tv.theiet.org/technology/infopro/10462.cfm). Summary: The all-pervasive nature of the general-purpose computer has made the most profound mark on almost every aspect of our lives. The central seminal figure in this computer revolution was Alan Turing, whose outstanding originality and vision was what made it possible, in work originating in the mid 1930s. Although it is now hard to see what the limits of the computer revolution might eventually be, it was Turing himself who pointed out to us the very existence of such theoretical limitations.
- [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile/videos) is a new YouTube Channel that interviews academics about various topics in Computer Science
