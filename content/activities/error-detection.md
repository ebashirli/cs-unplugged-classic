## Card Flip Magic

The world is noisy place, and errors can occur whenever information is stored or transmitted. Error detection techniques add extra parity bits to data to determine when errors have occurred.

This activity is a magic trick which most audiences find intriguing. In the trick the demonstrator is "magically" able to figure which one out of dozens of cards has been turned over, using the same methods that computers use to figure out if an error has occurred in data storage.

- [Try Engineering](https://tryengineering.org/) has an activity called  [Cracking the Code](https://tryengineering.org/teacher/cracking-code/) which explores the concept of how computerized barcoding has simplified distributing and pricing of products. Students learn about encoding and decoding, the barcoding system, and how a mathematical formula is embedded in barcoding to safeguard against errors. Students use websites to identify product barcodes, test codes from everyday product, and work as an "engineering team" to come up with the next generation of information embedding systems.

Gasman at [Center for Discrete Mathematics & Theoretical Computer Science at Rutgers University](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/) has an fully developed lesson plan in [Hamming Codes: Detecting and Correcting Errors](http://archive.dimacs.rutgers.edu/drei/1997/classroom/lessons/hamming.html).
