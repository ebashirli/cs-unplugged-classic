## Tourist Town

Like the [Graph Coloring problem]({{< ref "activities/graph-colouring" >}}), the dominating set problem is one that no efficient solution has been found for, even though it is very simple to describe.

This activity explores the problem, and sets it up as the basis for a the [Public Key Encryption activity]({{< ref "activities/public-key-encryption">}}).
