## Marching Orders

Computer programs are sequences of instructions that the computer must follow. There are hundreds of computer languages, but all involve giving clear and unambiguous instructions to a devices that doesn't understand meanings.

This activity demonstrates some of the issues that arise when we try to give precise instructions to achieve a desired outcome.

This activity illustrates the fact that a program is a series of instructions that tells a computer exactly what to do. So, a computer scientist must design the program carefully, to be sure that the computer will do the right thing. Please note that this activity requires the use of a Lego Rover robot.

As well as introducing programming, it exposes students to the idea of open-source development, and also programming language design.
