## The Peruvian Coin Flip

This is another activity that achieves something that doesn't seem possible – people who don't trust each other and can't see each other are able to agree on the outcome of a random coin flip.

This is an absorbing activity for an individual student or a whole classroom.

- *[Requires software download]* [Wolfram Demonstrations Project ](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/index.html)has the following demonstration activities. Note: You will need to install the [Wolfram CDF Player ](http://www.wolfram.com/player/) in order to use these activities. You can either download each demonstration or use your browser to run it.
    - [Solve the Cryptoquote: ](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/SolveTheCryptoquote/) Try your hand at decoding some famous quotes encoded using a substitution cipher. The person to whom the quote is attributed is encoded after the quote. Each cipher is a derangement of the letters of the alphabet, so that no letter stands for itself. If you need a hint to get started, the "show hint" button will randomly select a letter in the coded message and decode it for you.
    - [Solve the Cryptoquote Automatically: ](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/SolveTheCryptoquoteAutomatically/) A cryptoquote is a puzzle, commonly found in newspapers, in which a substitution cipher is used to encrypt a famous quote. Here a brute force approach is taken to automatically decipher the encrypted text for 33 different puzzles listed in order of difficulty. The encrypted puzzle is dynamically updated as the solution progresses. Experiment with different solving strategies to enhance or degrade performance.
    - [Decoding the Arecibo Message: ](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/DecodingTheAreciboMessage/) In 1974 a message was beamed from the Arecibo radio telescope towards a cluster of stars 25,000 light years distant in the constellation of Hercules. It consisted of 1679 binary digits transmitted in sequence. To read the message, the binary digits must be formed into a low resolution image on a two dimensional grid. But what sized grid should be used? Use the slider control to vary the number of columns in the grid and "decode" the Arecibo message.
    - [Learn the Radio Code: ](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/LearnTheRadioCode/) This Demonstration is one way to learn the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) radio code. It lists several words and displays the conversion to the radio code. It can also speak the converted answer.
    - [Substitution Cipher Encoder: ](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/CipherEncoder/)Substitution ciphers are one of the simplest forms of encryption, where replacement rules are provided that map each letter of the alphabet onto a different letter.This tool will generate randomly chosen keys that map the 26 letters of the English alphabet onto themselves. It also generates snippets of sample text from a range of English sources.
    - [Vernam Cipher: ](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/VernamCipherOneTimePad/)This Demonstration generates a random bit key for both sender and receiver of the Vernam cipher and provides a simple way to encryptand decrypt messages in various Unicode-supported languages.
    - [Hackers Language: ](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/HackersLanguage/)Criminal hackers usually leave messages when breaking into a website or any system. The messages are written in a kind of code. It is not meant to be cryptography; the idea is just to show that it was left by a hacker. The language replaces some characters, for example: t to 7, B to 8, l to 1, i to !, s to z, and so on, but there is no strong rule. There are also legal hackers who program free software and open source projects such as Linux Kernel, KDE and Gnome user interfaces, Apache web server, and many others.
    - [RSA Encryption and Decryption: ](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/RSAEncryptionAndDecryption/) The RSA algorithm for public-key encryption was originated by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman at MIT in 1977. Several similar methods had been proposed by earlier workers. The algorithm is based on the fact that it is far more difficult to factor a product of two primes than it is to multiply the two primes. Even the most powerful modern supercomputers would require more time than the age of the universe to factor a 400-digit number.
    - [Hill Cipher Encryption and Decryption: ](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/HillCipherEncryptionAndDecryption/) In a Hill cipher encryption, the plaintext message is broken up into blocks of length according to the matrix chosen. Each block of plaintext letters is then converted into a vector of numbers and is dotted with the matrix. The results are then converted back to letters and the ciphertext message is produced. For decryption of the ciphertext message, the inverse of the encryption matrix must be found. Once found, the decryption matrix is then dotted with each -block of ciphertext, producing the plaintext message.
    - [An Unforgettable Substitution Code: ](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/AnUnforgettableSubstitutionCode/)The characters in the two keywords give the beginning of the encryption alphabet completed by the remaining characters.
    - [Additive Cipher: ](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/AdditiveCipher/)The mono-alphabetic substitution cipher provides the simplest form of cryptography, where the cipher alphabet is simply a rearrangement of the plaintext alphabet. In an additive cipher, the cipher alphabet is a shift of the plaintext alphabet.
    - [Visual Encryption Pad: ](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/VisualEncryptionPad/)Only one position of the random mask will reveal clear text hidden in the cypher pad. The security of the code depends on a safe way to pass or keep the random mask. Application of the trivial rules {0->1, 1->0, 2->1} to the sum of clear text and random mask generates the cypher pad.
    - [Redundancy in Written Language: ](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/PoemMaker/)Languages have different levels of redundancy. Move the slider to remove increasing numbers of letters. Some languages remain readable even after removing a significant portion of the letters, while others become unreadable much sooner.

Professor White, cryptographer extraordinaire, is on the trail of the notoriously uncrackable Thomas Beale cipher—a century-old riddle hiding the location of a fortune in gold that has tormented its pursuers since inception. But White is not alone—shadowy forces are tight on his tail. The film contains 16 hidden messages that hold clues to the characters' secrets. Eight are fairly easy and require only a close eye. Six are moderately difficult using various encryption methods. Two are extremely difficult and will require a genius mind to decrypt.
