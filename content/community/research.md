We've collected lots of references to papers, posters and reports that have been published that are about Unplugged, or make use of Unplugged.
A key reference that was written around the 20th anniversary of the Unplugged project is the following, which gives a rather detailed history of the project and its philosophy:

> Bell, T., Rosamond, F., & Casey, N. (2012). Computer Science Unplugged and related projects in math and computer science popularization. In H. L. Bodlaender, R. Downey, F. V Fomin, & D. Marx (Eds.), *The Multivariate Algorithmic Revolution and Beyond: Essays Dedicated to Michael R. Fellows on the Occasion of His 60th Birthday* (Vol. LNCS 7370, pp. 398–456). Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg. doi:dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2344236

The following 2018 reference is an updated survey of how CS unplugged has been used:
