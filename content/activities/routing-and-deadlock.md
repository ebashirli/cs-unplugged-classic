## The Orange Game

Computer networks are based on passing messages from computer to computer.
This sounds simple in principle, but in practice all sorts of contention and bottlenecks can occur.

This activity gives some first hand experience of such issues, with a game for a group of students.

- Misha Leder, a Software Engineer at Google has an activity called [ Message Routing ](https://sites.google.com/site/childrenandtechnology/presentation-12-message-routing) which can be a nice extension activity. Internet works this way – computer networks are connected with each other via routers. Have kids sit at several tables, every child being a server. Have representatives for each tables to act as routers. Kids write messages to each other and routers help routing this messages.

Designed for advanced high-school algebra students, it can be worked out most easily using Microsoft Excel. Explore traffic engineering further with a competition developed at the University of Toronto, an animated diagram, and a game called [Gridlock Buster](http://www.its.umn.edu/GridlockBuster/).
