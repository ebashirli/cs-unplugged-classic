## Count the Dots

The binary number system plays a central role in how information of all kinds is stored on computers.
Understanding binary can lift a lot of the mystery from computers, because at a fundamental level they're really just machines for flipping binary digits on and off.
There are several activities on binary numbers in this document, all simple enough that they can be used to teach the binary system to anyone who can count! Generally children learn the binary system very quickly using this approach, but we find that many adults are also excited when they finally understand what bits and bytes really are.

    - [Bitmaps Activity](http://cse4k12.org/binary/bitmaps.html) where bitmaps are a way of encoding black and white images using binary numbers. A '0' is used to represents a white square in the image and a '1' is used to represent a black square. These worksheets provide a set of 8×8 grids where the student can draw their own black and white images and then write the corresponding binary (and hexadecimal) values.
    - [Crossbin Puzzles Activity](http://cse4k12.org/crossbin/index.html) is similar to crossword puzzles except that the clues are hexadecimal numbers, and the answers are binary numbers ('0's and '1's) instead of words. Also, once the puzzle is complete, if you fill all the '1' squares with black you will see a small picture or pattern.
    - [Perfect Shuffles Activity](http://cse4k12.org/binary/perfect_shuffle.html): If you want to take the top card in a deck and shuffle it down to a particular position, all you need to know is the binary representation of the position where you want the card to go. Then you perform a sequence of 'in' and 'out' perfect shuffles based on the binary number and the card will be shuffled into the desired location.
    - [Binary Magic Trick](http://cse4k12.org/binary/magic_trick.html): A set of 6 cards for a simple magic trick where you can correctly guess the secret number chosen by a student. Understanding how the trick works requires knowledge of binary

    - [Decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal): The decimal numeral system (also called base ten or occasionally denary) has ten as its base. Positional decimal systems include a zero and use symbols (called digits) for the ten values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) to represent any number, no matter how large or how small.
    - [Hexadecimal ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal): uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0–9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F (or alternatively a through f) to represent values ten to fifteen.
    - [Octal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal): The octal numeral system, or oct for short, is the base-8 number system, and uses the digits 0 to 7. Numerals can be made from binary numerals by grouping consecutive binary digits into groups of three (starting from the right).
    - [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii): The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (acronym: ASCII; pronounced /ˈæski/, ASS-kee)[1] is a character-encoding scheme based on the ordering of the English alphabet.

Hidden in the story are mathematical concepts related to doubling: powers of two, geometric sequences, geometric series, and exponents. I will analyze the story from this perspective, and then discuss my experience reading it to first and third grade students.

- Abdullah Seddiq (MIT Blossoms) has [Counting Systems ](https://blossoms.mit.edu/videos/lessons/counting_systems) with teacher's guides and additional resources. This video aims to explain counting systems (Decimal, Binary, Hexadecimal). Students will get to know how to convert numbers between these systems. Also students will learn how to do some byte and bit level operations. They will use a Visual Basic (VB) application that changes colors through logical operation on numbers.

- Hanan Al Arfaj (MIT Blossoms) has an extension lesson: [The Mailman and the Five Packages: Data Packets and Data Transfer Speed ](https://blossoms.mit.edu/videos/lessons/mailman_and_five_packages_data_packets_and_data_transfer_speed) with teacher's guides and additional resources. This video aims to explain the process of data transfer throughout computer systems and the form the data gets transferred into. Prerequisites for this lesson include some knowledge of the concept of digital data and an understanding of file size units (Bits, Bytes, Kilobytes, etc).
- [Pete Hawkes ](https://vimeo.com/petehawkes)demonstrates his [Binary Glove ](https://vimeo.com/9054854), where each finger represents a bit value in a simple binary sequence: 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. Pressure sensors in the ends of each finger register each bit as on or off.
- [Attic Academy ](https://www.youtube.com/user/AtticAcademy?feature=watch) has the [Basics of Binary ](http://youtu.be/EXSHz1Ock-c)
- [Rutgers University CS ](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/)has the [Octopus Counting](http://youtu.be/4p-9-nK-mwY): Watch how each tentacle represents one bit. Eight tentacles = eight powers of 2! A great way to teach students how to learn the basics of binary arithmetic.
