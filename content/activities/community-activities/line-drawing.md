## Walking the line

Computers draw lines and circles during many common tasks, such as using an image editor. But how does a computer know which pixels to darken to make a line?

This activity shows how difficult it is for a computer to do something as simple as drawing a straight line or a circle, and shows a clever way (Bresenham's algorithm) to do it quickly.

This exercise was developed by Joshua Scott (University of Canterbury).
