Computer Science Unplugged is an ongoing project that links a community of like-minded people and organisations. We share a few [core principles]({{< ref "about/principles" >}}), but we develop projects around the world according to the needs of different countries, and share [research]({{< ref "community/research" >}}) and experience to help everyone find new ways of teaching computer science concepts.

Unplugged was started by [Tim Bell](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/engineering/contact-us/people/tim-bell.html), [Mike Fellows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fellows) and [Ian Witten](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ihw/), and is now being explored by several dozen contributors working in many countries (including New Zealand, USA, Sweden, Australia, China, Korea, Taiwan and Canada). We like to keep track of everybody on our [People page]({{< ref "about/people" >}}).


Unplugged's international advisory team provides guidance to the project, and includes representatives of K-12 education (elementary and high school), professional bodies, researchers, and employers.

Unplugged is also supported and promoted by many organisations and companies around the world.
