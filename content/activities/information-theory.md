## Twenty Guesses

Computers are all about storing and moving information, but what actually is information? How do we measure the amount of information in a message?

This activity uses some intriguing variations on the game of 20 questions to demonstrate how we can quantify information content, which in turn shows us how to store and share it efficiently.
