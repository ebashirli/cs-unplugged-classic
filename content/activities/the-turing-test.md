## Conversations with Computers

Artificial intelligence has been researched for decades, and has resulted in many useful products, but still no system that is as intelligent as a human.

This activity explores just how we might recognise whether a system is truly "intelligent". It involves reasoning about what it means to be intelligent, and even what makes us human.

- [Eliza:](http://www.manifestation.com/neurotoys/eliza.php3) An AI simulation of a Psychotherapist. ELIZA has almost no intelligence whatsoever, only tricks like string substitution and canned responses based on keywords. Yet when the original ELIZA first appeared in the 60's, some people actually mistook her for human. The illusion of intelligence works best, however, if you limit your conversation to talking about yourself and your life

- [A Turing Machine – In the Classic Style ](http://aturingmachine.com/index.php) is a machine that embodies the classic look and feel of the machine presented in Turing’s paper. The heart of the turing machine is the read-write head. The read-write head transports the tape and positions cells of the tape appropriately. It can read a cell determining what, if any, symbol is written there. The machine works on, and knows about, only one cell at a time. The tape in my machine is a 1000’ roll of white 35mm film leader. The characters, ones and zeros, are written by the machine with a black dry erase marker.
